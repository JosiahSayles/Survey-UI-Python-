# Survey-UI-Python-

I’m currently building a small desktop UI project using Python (Tkinter) to create a quick customer experience survey for a pseudo company. This project focuses on structuring user input forms, handling layout with grid-based design, and collecting survey responses in a clean, intuitive interface.

As Python is a new language I’m actively self-learning, this project has been a great way to reinforce core concepts while applying them to a practical, real-world use case. I’m enjoying the challenge of translating UI/UX ideas into functional Python code and continuing to expand my skill set beyond web development.

Looking forward to refining this project and building more with Python as I grow as a developer. 💻📈
